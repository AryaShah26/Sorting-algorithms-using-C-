# Sorting-algorithms-using-C-
## Description  This project compares six sorting algorithms in C++ on a list of 100,000 elements. It shows how algorithm choice impacts performance, highlighting why efficient `O(N log N)` sorts like QuickSort and MergeSort outperform slower `O(NÂ²)` methods on large datasets.
